## Phase 1: BGP Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

_Add BGP awareness while maintaining current functionality_

### Week 1

#### **1.1.1**: Create BGP type definitions

- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Started**: December 19, 2024
- **Completed**: December 19, 2024
- **Challenges**: None - comprehensive type system designed from the start
- **Notes**: Created 40+ interfaces including AgentRoute, AgentPeer, AgentRoutingTable, RoutingPolicy, advanced matching, health metrics, multi-path, route reflection, and network topology support. Added type guards and constants for BGP defaults.

#### **1.1.2**: Implement route table management

- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Started**: December 19, 2024
- **Completed**: December 19, 2024
- **Challenges**: Complex three-table BGP structure implementation
- **Notes**: Full BGP Adj-RIB-In/Loc-RIB/Adj-RIB-Out implementation with advanced querying (capability patterns, AS path, communities), statistics, validation (loop detection, stale routes), and debugging tools. 24/24 tests passing!

#### **1.2.1**: Extend configuration for AS numbers

- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Started**: December 19, 2024
- **Completed**: December 19, 2024
- **Challenges**: RFC 6996 AS number ranges (64512-65534, not 65001+), test expectations needed adjustment
- **Notes**: Full BGP-aware configuration system with auto-generated AS numbers (64512+), backwards compatibility via legacy functions, BGP timers, router ID generation, policy loading, and comprehensive validation. 20/20 config tests + 24/24 route table tests = 44/44 total tests passing!

#### **1.2.2**: Update tools for new configuration

- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Started**: December 19, 2024
- **Completed**: December 19, 2024
- **Challenges**: Type system updates for ServerConfig vs URL strings, implementing BGP-style path selection algorithm
- **Notes**: Transformed both MCP tools into BGP-aware engines! list-mastra-agents now shows AS numbers, regions, priorities + conflict detection across AS boundaries. agent-proxy now uses BGP path selection algorithm (priority ‚Üí region ‚Üí AS number tie-breaking) for intelligent routing. Enhanced output schemas with routing info. 44/44 tests still passing!

#### **1.3.1**: Add AS path tracking

- **Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING
- **Started**:
- **Completed**:
- **Challenges**:

#### **1.3.2**: Update resolution logic

- **Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING
